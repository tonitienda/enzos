# Agent Instructions for Shell

- Keep shell command dispatch simple; prefer straightforward conditional checks over heavy registries while the command set is tiny.
- Preserve tab-based indentation and avoid heap use when adding shell features.
- When adding new commands, document their learning value (e.g., demonstrates argument parsing or terminal output) in commit messages or PR notes.
