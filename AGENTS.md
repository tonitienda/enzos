# Agent Instructions

These conventions apply to all files in this repository:

- Write documentation in Markdown using Title Case headings.
- Favor short paragraphs and bullet lists for clarity.
- Use fenced code blocks with explicit language hints when showing commands or code.
- Keep the tone educational: explain why something matters, not just what to type.
- When describing scripts, note the intent, required tools, and how to run them.
